# ðŸ›’ Walmart Sales Forecasting

Forecasting weekly sales across Walmart stores using XGBoost regression and time-series feature engineering. The project analyzes holiday impacts, identifies high-volatility stores, and forecasts future sales.

## ðŸ“Œ Objectives
- Predict weekly sales per store
- Analyze holiday effects on sales
- Identify stores with volatile sales patterns
- Forecast next 4 weeks using autoregressive modeling

## ðŸ§ª Tools & Techniques
- Python, Pandas, NumPy
- XGBoost, Scikit-learn
- Seaborn, Matplotlib
- Feature engineering: lag variables, seasonality, rolling means
- Evaluation metrics: RMSE, MAE, RÂ²
- Statistical analysis: t-test on holiday impact

## ðŸ“‰ Model Performance
| Metric   | Value       |
|----------|-------------|
| RMSE     | 18,363.12   |
| MAE      | 12,362.91   |
| RÂ² Score | 0.9988      |

> âœ… High predictive accuracy using time-aware XGBoost modeling and engineered features.

## ðŸ“Š Key Insights
- **Holidays boost sales** significantly (*p < 0.05*)
- **Store 4, 10, 20** are most volatile â†’ need better forecasting/inventory plans
- Model effectively generalizes across stores with low error and high RÂ²
